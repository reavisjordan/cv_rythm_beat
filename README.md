# CV-Rhytm-Beat
CV Rhythm Beat is a rhythm game designed as a VR experience for those who may not have access to headsets, controllers, and other expensive equipment. Developed in Unity, CVRB utilizes Python libraries CVZone and MediaPipe to capture your hands through a webcam and use them as controllers. Line up your hands, and hit the moving squares as they overlap with the static ones to increase your score!

# How to Play
The only prerequisites needed to play CVRB are a computer, webcam, a Python-supporting IDE of your choice, and the current version of Unity Hub. To begin, open your IDE and navigate to the `cv_rhythm_beat` directory. From there, run `python main.py` to start the hand tracking program. Next, open Unity Hub; navigate to the `cv_rhythm_beat` directory, and select the `CV_RB_2023` folder. Finally, press the play button at the top-middle section of the screen, and most importantly have fun!
